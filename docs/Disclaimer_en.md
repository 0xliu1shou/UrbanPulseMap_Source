## **3. Content Copyright Statement**
### **3.1 Ownership of Copyright**
- The copyright of all data used in this project belongs to the respective news publishers.
- The front-end demonstration (Demo) of the project is a technical validation tool that visualizes algorithms analyzing geographical information in news content. It is not a commercial product or service.
- The Demo serves as a technical extension of publicly available information and does not replace or redistribute original content. The project does not infringe upon the copyrights of the original news content.

### **3.2 Source Legitimacy**
- The news data used in the project is sourced exclusively from publicly available RSS feeds adhering to standard RSS usage norms.
- The project does not access or utilize any subscription-based, paid, or restricted content, ensuring legal and legitimate data sources while avoiding any adverse impact on the economic interests of news publishers.

### **3.3 Limited Use**
- The project does not redistribute complete RSS data in any form. Data usage is restricted to analysis, processing, and displaying limited fields (e.g., title, summary, publication date, and link), without utilizing the full content of the news.
- The project plans to selectively use an average of 20 news items per publicly available RSS source daily, focusing on those containing explicit geographical information to validate algorithmic performance.

### **3.4 Attribution of Sources**
- All used news data is attributed to the original media outlet, with direct links provided to the original articles.
- The project encourages potential visitors to access the original media platforms via these links, thereby generating traffic and enhancing public recognition of the content source.

### **3.5 Original Presentation**
- The data fields used in the Demo are preserved in their original format, with only technical wrappers like CDATA removed for clarity.
- The project does not alter or comment on the content of the news, ensuring no infringement on the rights of the data sources.
